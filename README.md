## Overview

`belugas-ruby` is an engine for detecting application [features](#what-is-a-feature) for Ruby projects based on static analysis, in other words `belugas-ruby` engine can detect the language, framework, database & dependencies your Ruby application is using.

This engine works as command line interface on your local machine of a Docker container:

## Why?

`belugas-ruby` is part of the [Whales](https://github.com/whalesli/whales) ecosystem: A set of tools to automatically dockerize your applications.

## What is a feature?

A feature is an application attribute detected during the static analysis. This analysis is the act of derivating data from code such as programming language, frameworks, service dependencies and so on. See [here](#supported-features) for a list of attributes this engine currently supports.

A feature has the following format:

```
{
  "type":"feature",
  "name":"Ruby",
  "version":"2.4",
  "description":"The application uses Ruby code",
  "content":"",
  "categories":["Language"],
  "cue_locations":[""],
  "engines":["belugas","belugas-ruby"]
}
```

Where:

- **type**: Will always be a _feature_.
- **name**: This is the name of the language, framework or database that is being used in the application. 
- **version**: The detected version of the feature. This one is optional
- **description**: A string explaining the feature that was detected.
- **content**: A markdown snippet describing the feature, including deeper explanations and links to other resources. This one is optional
- **categories**: Features are associated with one or more of the following categories: Language, Framework, Database, Library & Service.
- **cue_locations**: An array of Location objects representing the places in the source code that provide evidence of the detected feature. This one is optional
- **engines**: An array of engine names that detected the feature, or refined the data detected by the previous engines.

### Supported Features

Currently `belugas-ruby` can detect the following frameworks, databases, libraries and services:

Frameworks:

- Rails
- Sinatra
- Middleman

Databases:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Mongoid

Libraries & Services:

- Webkit
- Rmagick
- Sidekiq


## Installation

### Prerequisites

The Belugas Ruby CLI is distributed and run as a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/whalesli/belugas-ruby/) image, so you only need to have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and running on your machine.

### Setup

Fire up your terminal and run: 

```console
docker pull whalesil/belugas-ruby:latest
```

And that's it! 

## Usage

Here's where the magic begins, first of all in your terminal go to the project directory you want to analyze:

```console
cd code/path_to_project/
```

And then just execute the following command:

```console
docker run \
  --interactive --tty --rm \
  --volume "$PWD":/code \
  whalesil/belugas-ruby
```

And voil√°! The terminal will stream a json output for each of the features detected in the following format: 

```
{
  "type":"feature",
  "name":"Ruby",
  "version":"2.3.1",
  "description":"The application uses Ruby code",
  "categories":["Language"],
  "engines":["belugas","belugas-ruby"]
}
{
  "type":"feature",
  "name":"rails",
  "version":"4.2.6",
  "description":"The application uses rails",
  "content":"",
  "categories":["Framework"],
  "cue_locations":[""],
  "engines":["belugas","belugas-ruby"]
}
{
  "type":"feature",
  "name":"postgresql",
  "version":"9.5.6",
  "description":"The application uses postgresql",
  "content":"",
  "categories":["Database"],
  "cue_locations":[""],
  "engines":["belugas","belugas-ruby"]
}
{
  "type":"feature",
  "name":"sidekiq",
  "version":"0",
  "description":"The application uses sidekiq",
  "content":"",
  "categories":["Service"],
  "cue_locations":[""],
  "engines":["belugas","belugas-ruby"]
}
```
